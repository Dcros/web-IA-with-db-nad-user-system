# Web-IA
It is an "AI" created in web written in "JavaScript" and "PHP" with its own database that can recognize voice can respond with voice can do actions at the moment the only two actions you can do is recognize users and tell you the time What do you do in a specific place in addition to respond youeligente to some basic questions.

Can do:
Speech Recognition, Text - Speech so IA can talk, indentify users by they usernames and password, the only API Ia uses its the wather tell API everything else its writen by me no other apis, can answer basic questions, change from english to spanish IA lang.

Cant do:
Use aps in your device(in a future it will be possible), complex talking(working on it)...

By now: you can have this ia in any device you want you just need a browser in your Application(visualstudio,xcode,androidstudio)and use json and you can take words inputed in the IA make respond IA to that words by the web-side and the APP-SIDE by the combination of that words can open process in your dice example in windows:

Say to IA: Open Browser -->JSON takes (Open) and (Browser) --->at this 2 words made in visual basic(windows) open chrome.exe.

Its just an example but anyway it can be done...
